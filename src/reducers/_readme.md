* Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store. 
* The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
* It's called a reducer because it's the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). It's very important that the reducer stays pure


# KEEP IN MIND :
# ---------------
1) Given the same arguments, the reducer should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.
2) Redux always calls our reducer with an undefined state for the first time. 

# BEST PRACTICES :
# ---------------
1) keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting.
2) Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists.
3) Think of the app's state as a database.
4) How state object should be normalized: https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr
5) It's important to return the previous state for any unknown action.

# Things you should never do inside a reducer :
# -------------------------------------------
1) Mutate its arguments;
2) Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
3) Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().

# Combining Reducers :
# -------------------------------------------
1) combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.
2) The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()

- so instead of writing this: 
const todoApp = (state = {}, action) => {
  return {
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(action),
    todos: todos(state.todos, action),
  }
}
- with combineReducers we do:
const todoApp = combineReducers({
  todos,
  visibilityFilter
})
